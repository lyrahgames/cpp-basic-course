# Basics of Plotting

C++ itself does not provide any plotting mechanisms.
But there are a lots of good libraries which are to do this in an efficient and easy way.
We want to use [QCustomPlot] as it is an open source extension to the [Qt] library.
This seems to be a perfect idea since Qt allows us to create efficient and good-looking GUI applications.

## Requirements
- [Qt] version 5
- [QCustomPlot]
