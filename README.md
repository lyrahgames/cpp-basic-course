# Introduction to Programming with C++

## Background
### Hardware, Software and Abstraction Mechanisms
### Why C++?
### Why not C++?
### C++ is not C

## Setting up the Basic Build Environment
### C++ Compiler
### Editor

## Style Guides and Automatic Formatting

## References and Literature
### Online References
To remember every C++ command and how to use it should be impossible.
Therefore some references for the C++ language and their respective standard libraries is obligatory.
Especially online references seem to be most efficient, because the complete content can be accessed nearly everywhere at every time.
We recommend the following:
- [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/)

CMake is a powerful tool for generating your build system independent of the underlying computer system.
The official documentation describes every command in detail.
- [CMake Reference Documentation](https://cmake.org/documentation/)

### Reference Books
For convenience, one should use some good books or e-books in addition to online sources.
The best books in our opinion are the books by 'Bjarne Stroustrup', the creator of C++.
- Bjarne Stroustrup, *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++*
- Bjarne Stroustrup, *The C++ Programming Language*
- Herbert Schildt, *C++: The Complete Reference*

### Further Reading
- Stephan Roth, *Clean C++: Sustainable Software Development Patterns and Best Practices with C++17*
- Scott Meyers, *Effective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs*
- Scott Meyers, *Effective Modern C++: 42 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of C++11 and C++14*
- Andrei Alexandrescu, *Modern C++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied*

## External Libraries
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page): C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/): Library for creating fluid, high-performance and intuitive UIs, applications, and embedded devices – with the same code base for all platforms
- [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest): C++ testing framework which is by far the fastest both in compile times and runtime compared to other feature-rich alternatives
