# The Basics

>C++ is a compiled language. For a program to run, its source text has to be processed by a com-
piler, producing object files, which are combined by a linker yielding an executable program. A
C++ program typically consists of many source code files (usually simply called source files).

>An executable program is created for a specific hardware/system combination; it is not portable,
say, from a Mac to a Windows PC. When we talk about portability of C++ programs, we usually
mean portability of source code; that is, the source code can be successfully compiled and run on a
variety of systems.
