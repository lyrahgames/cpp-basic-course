Finding simple solutions for some problems is nearly impossible. Albeit, the documentation of CMake is complete, it does not help understanding and learning new features.
But the following references will give you some nice information about modern CMake and how to use it in a real world project.</p>

<p>Since 2018 there is now a real e-book about how to write effective modern CMake code. I am sure you will find a way how to get it.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/">Craig Scott, <em>Professional CMake: A Practical Guide</em>, 2018</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a living document about learning modern CMake.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/">An Introduction to Modern CMake</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And if you really want to see some examples for applying the new features then you should watch the following videos.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsXLMQ6WgIk">Daniel Pfeifer, <em>Effective CMake</em>, 2017</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC9-iRN2b04">Mathieu Ropert, <em>Modern CMake for Modular Design</em>, 2017</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ndUhdQuU8">Deniz Bahadir, <em>More Modern CMake</em>, 2018</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Hope I could show you something new. Have fun with it!</p>
